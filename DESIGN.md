# About the Database;

It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths.

- The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and plats are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens.
- This database is created to store more information about the use of antibiotics in the healthcare industry.
- The use of the database is primarily for healthcare workers to store information on:
    - The patients
    - The medication presscribed
    - The symptoms and signs of the patient
    - The reason for the prescription
    - The compliance of the medication
    - The follow up result of the patient
- Although the datasets taken as an example was focused on the research of AMR and the microorganism, this database focuses on storing and collecting the information of the patient and the health practicioner.
